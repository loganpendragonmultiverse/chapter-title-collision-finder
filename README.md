# Chapter Title Collision Finder

[![CI](https://github.com/loganpendragonmultiverse/chapter-title-collision-finder/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/loganpendragonmultiverse/chapter-title-collision-finder/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Find duplicate and confusingly similar chapter titles within or across manuscripts. The command runs locally, uses explicit UTF-8 JSON input, and produces deterministic JSON or Markdown reports without modifying the supplied source material.

## Three-minute start

```bash
python -m pip install .
chapter-title-collisions examples/sample.json
chapter-title-collisions examples/sample.json --format json --output report.json
```

The example documents the complete input shape. Version 1.1 supports `similarity_threshold`, `ignore_words`, and `comparison_scope` (`all`, `within`, or `cross`) and reports shared-token evidence for each candidate. Markdown is intended for immediate review; JSON preserves structured evidence for scripts and later comparison. An existing output file is never overwritten.

## Privacy and platforms

All title lists stay local.

Python 3.10 or newer is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The package has no runtime dependencies, telemetry, account, or hosted service.

## Interpretation boundary

Similarity is lexical and deliberately conservative. Shared thematic words may be intentional, and meaning is not inferred.

## Development

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest
python -m build
```

The project is feature-complete for its documented v1 scope. Maintenance focuses on correctness, security, compatibility, and well-supported input improvements.
